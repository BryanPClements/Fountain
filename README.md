# Fountain for Sublime Text #

This is an attempt to get the [Fountain](http://fountain.io) screenwriting syntax working in Sublime Text 2. This repo should work in TextMate as well, but the main testing is on Sublime Text 2 on a Mac.

Initial work on `Fountain.tmlanguage` created by Sublime Text forum use "nick" in [this post](http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=7442&p=31660).

More info to come.
